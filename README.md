Python Implementations of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) technologies:

* Lesk algorithms
  * Original Lesk (Lesk, 1986)
  * Adapted Lesk (Banerjee and Pederson, 2002)
  * Simple Lesk (with definition, example(s) and hyper+hyponyms)
  * Cosine Lesk (use cosine to calculate overlaps instead of using raw counts)
* Vector Space Models (in progress)
  * LSI/LSA
  * LDA
  * NMF
